The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This often happens when dealing with events or data loading where the expected object might not have been initialized yet.  
```actionscript
// Example: Attempting to access a property of a potentially null object
myObject.someProperty = "someValue";
```
